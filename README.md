# molecular_dynamics
exploration of MD simulations in MATLAB

# 2D Simulations
practice for 3D, just want to get the basic idea of the Verlet integrator demonstrated.

## simulations
contains all the main scripts which can be directly run in the MATLAB window. <br>
The main verlet algorithms are implemented directly inside the script (instead of partitioned as functions) since they are not too complicated
